        It would be extremly intresting to hear how everyone else found this
        party besides us, because I feel like most people left either feeling
        extremely uncomfortable, or too drunk to remember any part of the night.
        But for all the bullshit shenanigans that occured, I think it goes
        without saying that the night I met you for the first time in person. Is
        something Ill be forever thankful for and cherish as a lifelong memory
        that might even stay with me after im burned into ashes at 90 smth years
        old. Although Oliver is now a fabled nonce and Id kick the shit out of
        him if I had the chance. I have to give him credit where credit is due;
        he was a fucking world class wingman. As is liv shes awsome. Btw im on
        call to u as im writing this, ur really pretty but I digress. I do wanna
        just mention that if I wasn't patrolling Oliver like a fucking private
        investigator making sure he didnt creep on ppl. I probably would've
        stuck to u like a leech for the whole night, more than I already did for
        that matter.

      <h3>
        As corny as it sounds, I fell in love with you this night, I defo had a
        baby crush on you before this night but this was the night where i fell
        in love with you. I was shit scared girls at this point and almost wrote
        myself off due to my previous bad luck. That was until I saw you, I
        vividly remember sweating absolute bullets of nerves throughout the
        entire night. Pretty sure my highest heart rate was much above what it
        shouldve been but like oh well. You looked extremely beautiful and I
        would give anything to go back and re-live that night. Its hard to put
        into words my thoughts on this night so if this sounds rambelly i
        apologise but it feels like theres not enough words in the dictionary.
        Its like i felt every positive emotion all at once. Especially when
        after our kiss and when you had my jumper. You were so patient with me,
        so kind to me and so understanding that I can only say thank you. Every
        day since this date, you never really left my thoughts, not a single day
        goes by where I dont think about you. Ill never forget this night
        because of the way you made me feel. Thank you for everything, for all
        the time we have spend together since.
