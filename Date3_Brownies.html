        Although I am writing my feeling about the way this night went about 3-4
        ish months after it happened. I can still remember this like it was
        yesterday. Which is saying a lot since i forgot the name of dory from
        finding nemo ( ironic but oh well ) Point being this memory will forever
        be ingrained into my consious just purely for how beautiful and pure it
        was and i think you will agree. And also how good the brownies tasted
        afterward holy shit i miss them. To be honest I dont know how much I
        should mention this moment because I think it speaks for itself to be
        honest. All Ill say is I love you, and I now will forever accociate
        margeret by lana del ray with you, slow dancing and brownies â™¥
