        Its currently nearly 9 O clock at night and ive just come home from
        spending an entire afternoon with you. I met your brother today as well
        as your aunty and uncle and ate your mums fucking banging veggie
        lasange. Im writing this little message just to let you know that I
        think the world of you and im so thankful for you accepting me into your
        family in this way. There all so friendly and welcoming and im forever
        in dept for you. My family is awsome, but in someways slightly broken
        and so spending time with yours gave me an opportunity to feel the same
        way i did when i was a naieve little kid thinking my family was normal.
        You helped me realise, that when im older and (touch wood) i have my own
        little family. I want them to be like yours, where we are one loving
        family, but also treat eachother like friends because at least for me,
        family and friendship have always been two separate ideas, so once more,
        thank you for letting me be there and meet them. Also ur brother is mad
        cool ( tell him chris says "cake by the ocean")

        As I am writing this message, Im on ft to you. Its ten o clock at night
        and your sleeping peacefully. Life has given us both the largest of
        middle fingers today. For example, I have been shat on for the first
        time by a bastard seagull and you got stranded by a bus and had to wait
        like 3 hours before you could get to school. Regardless of this I wanted
        to jot down my thoughts that cycle through my head. A lot of the time,
        when im by myself quite like i am as im writing this, The thoughts in my
        head will rush and sort of collide together. The only way I can describe
        the noise of my thoughts is like when your in a crowded area and you
        hear everybodys conversations at once. It happens when I try and study
        or focus or am generally in a quiet environment while also being
        concious. However, even if it is just on ft, whenever your around, it
        helps stop this and im able to really hone and control the way my brain
        communicates which is a huge relief. Its something about the presence
        you give off thats extremly calming, which may sound crazy as when u
        have energy I swear you get zoomies. But I just want to say thank you
        for being a great person to anchor my thoughts onto whenever I cant
        organise them. Also in a non creepy way u look super cute when ur alseep
        and dreaming, and ur little snore as well ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

        Yoooooooooooooo im dying of covid rn and im bored af so I figured I may
        as well try and engage my brain in an activity rather than rotting
        playing arkham knight. Hence the batman picture. The weekend of me
        writing this ur parents left and we spend majority of the weekend
        together at yours and I genuienly cannot think of a time in my recent
        memory where I was so happy. Apart from the fact that we became the
        shitty rodent version of ghostbusters fighting the mice in ur walls with
        bree. It was so great to have that much time together. On the friday
        night we just chilled together cuddling in bed while watching Friday
        night dinner and ate veggie nuggets and watched spongebob. On the
        saturday we did the exact same shit but instead of nuggets it was pasta
        and lily and lily joined us later that night. I just really like cuddles
        so thanks for being a human stuffed animal that I can exchange body heat
        with.

        Apologies its been a while since ive written anything in here, Ive been
        so wrapped up in my own shit I havent had any time to leave a message.
        Between studying for various random exams and mocks and generally living
        life its been chaos so apologies for that. P.S u have really cute duck
        earings u just showed me them on a ft call. Anyway I digress, I just
        wanted to hop in here because its your beautiful birthday soon and I
        plan to give you the URL to this website on your B-Day. So happy
        birthday in advance for that my gorgous girl. I could get all sappy but
        I might create a different little section for that. Anyway life recap
        for the last month. We went on a couple of cool dates, we went to little
        monki to grab some amazing food ( we have to go back there idc what u
        say and im ordering your coconut rice. ) We did a whole lot of cuddling
        which is also nice. OOOH and valentines day happened so that was cool to
        not be lonley for IG. The gifts you gave me is safley tucked away in my
        drawer, I still read it from time to time and I am still trying to
        express how it makes me feel. In fact I was hoping this website would be
        my way of expressing my gratitude. So from the bottom of my heart thank
        you. Thank you for being you, thank you for taking the time, I struggle
        to truley express the way it makes me feel, but hopefully you
        understand.

        Ok ok fine im sorry, I promised myself that I would continue to update
        this after i gave it to you on your birthday but ive been so busy and im
        so so sorry that I havent already. School has been hectic (as well as
        playing loads of games but you didnt hear that.) Anyway how are you, I
        hope you are well. Its getting kinda late and I miss u, a lot. Im sorry
        if ive been distant, or if I seem off, I promise im okay its just school
        and exams being so close I feel like im drowning but I promise starting
        from now, im going to make a really concious effort to be better and to
        be the person someone as amazing as you deserves. Anyway life update rq
        going back as far as my memory can, we had our birthdays which was so
        cool, we did Zizi's as a date and met the super cool server that
        reminded us of luka, he was a legend. Lots of cuddles and playing with
        bree happened as always, we are both slowly loosing our minds to
        coursework. (which I am procrasinating rn to write this message) Driving
        lessons started for both of us and recently Liv's b-day which was
        awesome.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hope this message finds you well and does'nt get corrupted or some bs. I
        love you pretty girl, and check in here more regulary cause I promise
        ill be updating this little whatever more and more.
